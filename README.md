# image_classifier
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a multi-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for image classification tasks. The model leverages trade-offs from three popular deep learning models: VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet, to create a high-performing classifier.
